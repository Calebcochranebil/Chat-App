# Chat App

## Objective:

The objective of this project is to develop a mobile chat application using React Native. The application will allow users to engage in conversations, share images, and exchange location data.

### Key features:

-   User Registration: Users can enter their name and choose a background color for the chat screen before joining the chat.
-   Conversation Display: The app will display the ongoing conversation with an input field and submit button for sending messages.
-   Additional Communication Options: The chat app will support sending images and sharing location data.
-   Data Storage: The app will store data both online and offline, ensuring that messages can be accessed even without an internet connection.

### User stories:

-   As a user, I want to be able to send messages to my friends and family members to exchange the latest news.
-   As a user, I want to send images to my friends to show them what Iâ€™m currently doing.
-   As a user, I want to share my location with my friends to show them where I am.
-   As a user, I want to be able to read my messages offline so I can reread conversations at any time.
